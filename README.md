# Instructions for the Pricing Tables Assignment

## Overview
- There are 3 folders in this repository:
  - `pricing-table-1`: ChaiPatti - Pricing Table
  - `pricing-table-2`: Chai Aur Fitness - Membership Pricing Table
  - `screenshots`: Screenshots of the above 2 pricing tables 

## What to do?
1. In each of the 2 folders (`pricing-table-1`, `pricing-table-2`), you will find an `index.html` file and a `challenge.css` file.
2. Your task is to write the CSS code in the `challenge.css` file to style the `index.html` file so that it matches the design shown in the corresponding screenshot in the `screenshots` folder.

## Steps to Follow:
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the unstyled version of the page.
2. Open the `challenge.css` file in your code editor.
3. Write the necessary CSS code in the `challenge.css` file to style the `index.html` file.
4. Save your changes and refresh the browser to see the updated styles.
5. Repeat the process until the `index.html` file looks like the screenshot in the `screenshots` folder.

## Tips:
- Use browser developer tools to inspect elements and test your CSS code.
- Break down the task into smaller parts and tackle one section at a time.
- Ask for help if you get stuck, but try to solve the problem on your own first.

Good luck and have fun!
